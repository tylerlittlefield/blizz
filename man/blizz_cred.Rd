\description{
This function will add your BLIZZARD CLIENT ID,
BLIZZARD SECRET ID and BLIZZARD AUTH TOKEN to your \code{.Renviron} file so
it can be called securely without being stored in your code. After you have
installed your credentials, it can be called any time by typing
\code{Sys.getenv("BLIZZARD_CLIENT_ID")} and can be used in package functions
by simply typing BLIZZARD_CLIENT_ID. If you do not have an \code{.Renviron}
file, the function will create on for you. If you already have an
\code{.Renviron} file, the function will append the key to your existing
file, while making a backup of your original file for disaster recovery purposes.
